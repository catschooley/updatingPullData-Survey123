# #### Replacing Online Survey123 Pull Data with Local Update
# 
# To start we will import the required modules and define our variables.<br>
# **Please format folder directories as C:/Users/usernameâ€¦ include a trailing slash after the final folder name as the updated file directory is concatenated to the updated file name**
# 
# 
# The variables are defined as follows: 
# 
# * **portalURL** - The URL for your WebGIS Portal (ex. www.arcgis.com)
# * **username** - Your WebGIS Portal username (ex. gisadmin)
# * **password** - You WebGIS Portal password (ex. gisadmin1)
# * **itemID** - The Item ID for the ArcGIS Survey123 Form Item in you WebGIS Portal (ex. 89bc8c7844e548e09baa3aad4695e78b)
# * **download_folder** - The folder directory you would like the Survey123 Form Item to be downloaded with the trailing slash (ex. C:/temp/)
# * **updated_file** - The updated file name containing the extension (ex. pullData.csv)
# * **source_loc** - Folder directory where the updated file is located (ex. C:/users/username/arcgis/my survey designs/)

### Connect to GIS ###
