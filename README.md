# updatingPullData-Survey123
A template for updating the 'Pull Data' of the 'Media' folder in Survey123 using a Google Sheet shared in Google Drive. This template will pull in the new pull data as a csv, clean it from any whitespaces, commas, etc., then replace the pull data file currently used by the survey. A notification email is sent that this process has been completed.
